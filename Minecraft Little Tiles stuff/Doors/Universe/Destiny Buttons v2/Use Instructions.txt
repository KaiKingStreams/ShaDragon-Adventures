If you have previously installed any of my custom sounds for my LT structures,
check Guide 2 down here, if not - Guide 1!

Guide 1

- 0. If you don't want to use custom sounds, skip to step 3!

- 1. Drop "customdisc" folder to your .minecraft folder

- 2. Put "custom_disc.cfg" file in your config folder

- 3. Start game

- 4. Open "Destiny Ramp v3" file and copy everything from it

- 5. Place Little Importer, press "paste" and import the door

- 6. For better placement you can hold LShift for door to snap to blocks

- 7. Enjoy!

Guide 2

- 1. Copy files from new "customdisc" folder and merge them with your old one in
.minecraft

- 2. Open "custom_disc.cfg" file in your config folder, then add registers to it:
        dst_button
        dst_button_locked

- 3. If you made everything right, you are free to go!

P.S - Connect buttons with 4-bit little wire,
you can combine multiple buttons too!
